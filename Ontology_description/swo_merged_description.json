A probability distribution/density function assigns a\nnon-negative probability/density to each object of type T. Probably the most\ngeneral data mining task (Hand et al. 2001) is the task of estimating the (joint)\nprobability distribution D over type T from a set of data items or a sample\ndrawn from that distribution.\nAs mentioned above, in the most typical case we would have T = Tuple(T1,\n. . ., Tk), where each of T1, . . ., Tk is Boolean, Discrete(S) or Real. We talk about\nthe joint probability distribution to emphasize the difference to the marginal\ndistributions of each of the variables of type T1, . . ., Tk: the joint distribution\ncaptures the interactions among the variables.\nRepresenting multi-variate distributions is a non-trivial task. Two approaches\nare commonly used in data mining. In the density-based clustering paradigm,\nmixtures of multi-variate Gaussian distributions are typically considered (Hand\net al. 2001). Probabilistic graphical models, most notably Bayesian networks,\nrepresent graphically the (in)dependencies between the variables: Learning their\nstructure and parameters is an important approach to the problem of estimating\nthe joint probability distribution."

A prototypical instantiation\nof this task is the task of finding frequent itemsets (sets of items, such as\n{bread, butter}), which are often found together in a transaction (e.g., a market\nbasket) (Aggrawal et al 1993). The condition that a pattern (itemset) has to\nsatisfy in this case is to appear in (hold true for) a sufficiently high proportion\n(called support and denoted by s) of the transactions in the input dataset.\nWith the increasing interest in mining complex data, mining frequent patterns\nis also considered for structured data. We can thus talk about mining frequent\nsubsequences or mining frequent subgraphs in sequence or graph data. We can\nconsider as frequency the multiple occurrences of a pattern in a single data\nstructure (e.g., sequence or graph) or the single occurrences of a pattern in\nmultiple data structures."

However, a usage limitation is not necessarily due to whether or not something costs money: even if the usage is academic only, it could still be either free or non-free. A license could have multiple usage clauses, e.g. academic only when free, and unrestricted if a fee is paid. Purchase cost was created which, together with a usage clause, defines both limitations and cost."
