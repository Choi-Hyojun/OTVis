However, the latter are, in that context, meant to go only in amounts, not individual nuts or cookies; e.g., a bag of nuts, a packet of cookies. This is just a matter of scale: the basis type of the latter is the nut or cookie instead of the countable molecule, and it goes in quantities, like a bag of peanuts or packet of cookies. In addition, bulk can come as StructuredPureStuff (sugar), HomogenousMixedStuff (the processed peanut butter with the stabilizer and possibly also sugar, not the ones from the health shop that settle and separate in peanut paste and oil on top), and HeterogenousMixedStuff, like pet food and breakfast cereals.
